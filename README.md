# Mask Detection
CSC 790 - Deep Learning Project

 In this, a simple Face Mask detection system is built using the Deep Learning technique called as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This CNN Model is built using the TensorFlow framework and the OpenCV library which is highly used for real-time applications.
